# Fuzzy Tickets

This repository contains the project code for implementing a dynamic pricing stategy using the Sci-Kit Learn's Sci-Kit Fuzzy API and the Django Python web framework.

## Why?

This project was carried out as part of my 4th year honours project at Glasgow Caledonian University. The project is concerned with developing a fuzzy logic system for dynamically pricing live music event tickets which improves consumer attitudes towards dynamic pricing.

The FL system is implemented using the Sci-Kit Fuzzy API which contains a huge amount of features to assist with developing FL systems in Python.

The FL system is integrated into a ticket merchant web application which is developed using the Django Python web framework.

## Getting Started

If you wish to use the project code for yourself, you can clone the repository by navigating to an appropriate folder on a machine with Git installed and use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamieSmithGCU/FuzzyTickets.git
```

## Deployment

This project has been deployed using pythonanywhere.com.
